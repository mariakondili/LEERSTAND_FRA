# LEERSTAND_FRA
HackFrankfurt-Open Data on vacant properties ("Leerstand" auf Deutsch).

Provided by the webpage https://www.leerstandsmelder.de/frankfurt and extracted for analysis & further manipulation.

Once you pull the repo ,the script extract_leerstand.py can be used to read 
the extracted and better-structured information, organised per ID of each property.

Goal is to extract information like coordinates, ownership, address and use them to map better subsets of these 
properties, by categories like : "suitable for office", "suitable for living", "private", "public" etc.
