# LEERSTAND_FRA
HackFrankfurt-Open Data on vacant properties ("Leerstand" auf Deutsch).

Provided by the webpage https://www.leerstandsmelder.de/frankfurt and extracted for analysis & further manipulation.

Once you pull the repo ,the script extract_leerstand.py can be used to read 
the extracted and better-structured information, organised per ID of each property.

The goal is to extract information like coordinates, ownership, address and use them to better map subsets of these 
properties, by categories like : "suitable for office", "suitable for living", "private", "public" etc. 

Furthermore, I would like to use the most suitable subset in combination with other open databases, and provide the vacant-available properties for potential use through communities. :-)
